# Console and Gaming sales 
The database contains information about games and consoles.\
In the games database, there is information such as: game titles, the system they were created for, the number of units sold, the publisher, the game developer, release date, and a link to an image.\
In the console data database, there is information about: console names, their type, generation, production year, end of production date, number of consoles sold, additional information about the console, or links to gifs.

# Background
A SQL database was created based on two CSV files. The CSV files have been modified in Python for better data analysis.\
Detailed information regarding data modifications has been included in the [Data](Data) folder, while information regarding the creation of the database and tables, as well as loading the database, can be found in the [MSSQL_create_database](MSSQL_create_database) folder.

## :mag: The dataset was analyzed in terms of:
1. **Top 10 Sold Consoles**
2. **Top 10 Sold Games**
3. **Analysis of Console Popularity by Generation**
4. **Games Publisher Analysis**
5. **Games Developer Analysis**
6. **Publishing Trends Analysis**
7. **Market Analysis of Games by Console Type**
8. **Console Lifecycle Analysis**
9. **Top-Selling Games for a Specific Console**
10. **Analysis of Average Game Unit Sales by System**
11. **Average Sales of a Console in One Year**
12. **Best-Selling Game for a Specific Console**

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tools I used
For my analysis I utilized:
* SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights. 
* MS SQL Server: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the consoles ang games posting data.
* Python :snake: : For data manipulation and processing, data cleaning, and creating charts.
    * pymssql: For conneccting python with sql server and using sql in python.
    * nbformat: For loading different data and values other jupyter notebook.
    * pandas :panda_face: : For manipulation, cleaning and processing data.
    * numpy: :blue_square: : For manipulation and processing data.
    * matplotlib :chart_with_upwards_trend: : For creating charts.
* Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries and cleaning, processing, and visualization in Python.
* Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python and SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

## Dataset
The database was downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasgalanti/home-consoles-and-gaming-sales) website.

# :bar_chart: The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of consoles and released games. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question.

## 1. Top 10 the best sold consoles
The following query, after execution, will display a table of the top 10 consoles sold the most. The columns will contain information about the console name and the number of units sold in millions.\
This query was implemented in Python to create a chart displayed below the query.
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 
    Console_Name,
    Units_sold_in_million
FROM 
    Console
ORDER BY 
    Units_sold_in_million DESC
```
![Top 10 Consoles](images/Top%2010%20the%20best%20sold%20consoles.png)
From the analyses abowe, we can infer that:
* The most units were sold for the PlayStation 2 console - 155 million units.
* The PlayStation 5 console ranked 10th, with 55 million units sold.
* All consoles from Sony (PlayStation) are in the top 10.
* Three consoles are from Nintendo (Wii / Nintendo).
* Only two consoles are from Microsoft (Xbox).

## 2. This query identifies the top ten best-selling games along with the number of units sold in millions.
The following query, after execution, will display a table of the top 10 games sold the most. The columns will contain information about the games name and the number of units sold in millions.\
This query was implemented in Python to create a chart displayed below the query.
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 
    Game_Name,
    Units_m
FROM 
    Games
ORDER BY 
    Units_m DESC
```
![Top 10 Games](images/Top%2010%20the%20best%20sold%20games.png)
From the analyses abowe, we can infer that:
* In the top 10, only games created for Nintendo consoles were included.
* The game Wii Sports has a significant lead in the number of units sold, with over 80 million units.
* Four games in the top 10 are associated with the Mario universe.

## 3. Analysing popular of consoles depending on generation
This analysis groups consoles by generation and calculates the total units sold. It then compares sales across different console generations.
```sql
SELECT 
    Generation,
    SUM(Units_sold_in_million)[Units sold in million]
FROM 
    Console
GROUP BY 
    Generation
```
| Generation | Units sold in million |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 1          | 0.5                   |
| 2          | 35                    |
| 3          | 77                    |
| 4          | 82                    |
| 5          | 144                   |
| 6          | 210                   |
| 7          | 272                   |
| 8          | 189                   |
| 9          | 221                   |
From the above table, it can be concluded that:
* With each subsequent generation, the number of consoles sold in that generation increased.
* Up to the 7th generation, demand for consoles was growing.
* From the 8th generation onwards, the number of consoles sold started to decline.
* Looking at the 7th, 8th, and 9th generations, the least consoles were purchased in the 8th generation.

Detailed information about each generation is contained in the [SQL](Query_MSSQL.sql) file.

## 4. Games publisher analysis 
This section shows the number of games published by each publisher and the average number of units sold per game by the publisher.
```sql
SELECT 
    Publisher,

    Publisher
ORDER BY 
    [Number of games] DESC, 
    Publisher ASC

GROUP BY
    Release_Date
ORDER BY
    Release_Date
```
